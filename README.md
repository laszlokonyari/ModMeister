### Admin Commands

> All admin commands require the Admin role or Server Owner unless stated otherwise.

#### Moderation with Punishment Escalation

The warning system includes automatic tiered escalation:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/admin warn <user> <reason>` | Issue a warning to a member |
| `/admin warnings <user>` | View all warnings for a member |
| `/admin clear_warnings <user> [id]` | Clear all warnings or a specific one by ID |

**Punishment Escalation System:**
- Default thresholds: 3 warnings → mute, 6 warnings → kick, 8 warnings → ban
- Mute duration is configurable (default: 30 minutes)
- When a warning is issued, the system automatically checks if thresholds are exceeded
- If exceeded, the appropriate punishment is executed (mute → kick → ban progression)
- All punishment actions are logged and users receive notification embeds

**Example Configuration:**
```
/admin punishment_set mute 3 30        # Mute after 3 warnings for 30 minutes
/admin punishment_set kick 6 0         # Kick after 6 warnings
/admin punishment_set ban 8 0          # Ban after 8 warnings
```

### `members`
| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `guild_id` | INTEGER | Discord server ID |
| `user_id` | INTEGER | Discord user ID |

## Docker & Automatic Updates

ModMeister is fully containerized and uses **Watchtower** for seamless, zero-downtime updates. 

When you deploy the bot using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file, it pulls the latest pre-built image from the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`). Watchtower runs alongside the bot and checks the registry every 5 minutes. 

If a new version of ModMeister is published to the `master` branch, Watchtower will automatically:
1. Download the new image
2. Gracefully shut down the old container
3. Start the new container with your existing `.env` and `botdatabase.db`
4. Clean up the old, unused images

**Useful Docker Commands:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f      # View live console logs
docker compose restart      # Manually restart the bot
docker compose down         # Stop the bot and Watchtower
docker compose up -d        # Start the bot in the background
```

## Recent Improvements (April 2026)

### Music Playback Fixes

- Enhanced error handling with rollback capability on failed updates
- Added `.env` template generation during setup
- Improved logging with keyword prefixes (`[SETUP]`, `[START]`, `[STOP]`, `[UPDATE]`)
- Fixed Windows opus library loading issue for audio playback

### Punishment System Implementation
- Added tiered warning escalation system with configurable thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Start
- Ensure `.env` file exists and has `TOKEN` and `GUILD` set
- Check Python version: `python3 --version` (must be 3.10+)

### Music Commands Not Working
- Verify FFmpeg is installed: `ffmpeg -version`
- On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
- On macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Ensure bot has voice permissions in channels

### SoundCloud Tracks Return No Results
- Some tracks may be region-restricted or removed
- Try using direct SoundCloud URLs instead of search queries
- Spotify playlists are limited to 25 tracks to prevent spam

### Bot Crashes After Update
- Automatic rollback is enabled: `git reset --hard HEAD@{1}`
- Check dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

- `setup_server` and `wipe` are destructive and cannot be undone
- Private categories require an "Admin" role to exist in the server
- Spotify playback depends on SoundCloud availability of the track
- Spotify playlists are capped at 25 tracks to prevent spam
- Some commands may be affected by Discord API rate limits
